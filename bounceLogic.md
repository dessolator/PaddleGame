How the if statement works:						

								=============================================
								=											=
								o											o
								o					BLOCK					o
								=											=
								=============================================
								
If the ball hits the block in one of the parts marked with "=" the ball is reflected vertically.
If the ball hits the block in one of the parts marked with "o" the ball is reflected horizontally.
Note that parts of the sides also reflect the ball vertically, while this may seem logically incorrect, 
the effect achieved is a more realistic ball bounce in most cases.
